### Context 

After deciding what our tool will be, we have continued to tinker with it but also have ideas or inspiration for our freedom project before winter break. 

Before the year ends, our teacher decided it's best that we continue building with our tool. This allowed me to have an idea on what to focus on for this month, I jumped into more videos as it gave a lot of information and tips for projects that used my tool **Phaser**. Any website on the internet that can be helpful for beginners.







### EDP 

I feel like for now im still standing more **towards 3 than 4** because I still don't feel confident in my idea or possible solution for my project but hoping by next year I have a clear goal on what I want to build for my project.


### Skills 

Mostly **Time management** because it helped me spread out and plan what to search or focus on and prioritize important things that I had or questions on my tool. As well as **How to Learn** since in some websites it gave parts of code that felt advance for me but with looking over at the explanation has helped me get a sense of any code that i didn't understand and it's function.
