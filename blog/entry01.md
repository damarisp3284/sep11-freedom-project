### Context + Plan

We have staretd to decide what tools we would like to use for our **Freedom Project** and what will our Project be about. I decided to create a **Data Protection Game** as I would like to help others have online safety but also because when trying to find what we would build our teacher **Mr. Mueller** mentioned something that we can do to help the elderly protect there information as they are the most vunerable to scams that can lead to them into unknown links or websites that hackers use to then get access to there victim's device.

Using with what I have learned and other crediable sources from Professionals who try to give guides on what to be aware of or information that I can give to users to look out on there daily emails or messages.

### Tool

Once we plan what our Project will be we had to tinker and pick a tool, at first **Phaser.Js** and **Anime.Js** had interest me and I added them both as my main and back up but after some time of checking out others and not focusing on just those 2 I kept Phaser but changed my backup to **Kaboom.JS**.

Kaboom is more beginner-friendly as they have <a href = ""></a> 

### EDP

Im currently in between 3 and 4 as I do know that **Schools** and **Hospitals** are most affected as they have weak online security and may end up losing money and there private information as stated on <a href= "https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/edcast/25/04/cybersecurity-greatest-threat-schools-arent-ready"> Harvard Graduate School</a> and <a href ="https://www.aha.org/center/cybersecurity-and-risk-advisory-services/importance-cybersecurity-protecting-patient-safety">AHA Center For Health And Innovation</a>

Trying to get ideas on how I would like my game to be and how will I educate and entertain users, but with the help of the internet and games that can help me get inspiration on what I would like to build and make it my own version. See if I want to do a story-line game where users have to play as a person who got there data stolen clicking a link that they thought was real but it was a way for hackers to get in there computer and steal information

### Skills

Using the skills of Time management and Problem decomposition to help me navigate my task from deciding my tool but also helped me stay organized as 
* I planned out what tools to use and tinker with time I have decided to use 
* Using the internet and Youtube for tutorials or guide
* Figured out any issues that I had while tinkering
* How will my tool best fit me and my project
