### Conext
After winter break I took some time to think ahead on what I would like to tinker with using my tool **Phaser**, in this I went over the documentation and looked over at the different features that I could possibly use an ideas I had or create mini projects on my own.

### Tool

Seeing my past progress I decided to test out other features but then I realize I can use **DOM** using my tool, after reading over the documentation I started to brainstorm what I would like to create and looking over at a website called **Typing club** inspired me to create something similar to it as it helped me in the past will my typing stamina.

Then I started to build the game but still using both **Phaser** and **DOM** which game me

Once you press start it will give you a word to type but you are timed so it allows user's to test how fast they type while each word they manage to type correctly will give them a score

After the 30 secound timer is up, the game is over!

### EDP

As I gotten more comfortable with how Phaser works, **I feel more towards 4 and slightly moving onto 5** because knowing what my tool has to offer I now have started to think about what features I would like to use and sort of plan like a game with many different puzzles or make it into a short story again with using a puzzle theme. 

But hopefully with time I can finally decide on what type of game I would like to use with my topic of internect security as I started to slack less and actually stay on task more as were continuing foward untill it's time to build our projects and showcase them.

### Skills 

Sill my key skills of **Time Management** and **Growth Mindset** were important for me because with the break I got to take some time away from school which gave me more free time to spend it onto my freedom project while also having time myself away from school, I got to learn more clearly and was more focused about brainstorming ideas that I had althought they were not the biggest nor was I confident but I still took them in mind either way. 

Learned from mistakes like issues with characters not appearing or certain things despite having the script but I took this as a moment to learn and not get overwhelmed with why it's not working.
